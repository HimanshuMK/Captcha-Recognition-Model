# Captcha Recognition Model
This repository contains a Captcha Recognition Model built using deep learning techniques. The model aims to automatically recognize and solve CAPTCHA images.

## Overview
The Captcha Recognition Model utilizes convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to process and interpret CAPTCHA images. The model is trained on a dataset of CAPTCHA images to accurately predict the characters in the images.

## Contents
* 'Captcha_model.ipynb': Jupyter notebook containing the entire process of data preparation, model building, training, and evaluation.

## Installation
To run the notebook and train the model, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository
```
git clone https://github.com/HimanshuMK/Captcha-Recognition-Model.git
cd Captcha-Recognition-Model
```
2. Install the required dependencies:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
## Usage
1. Open the Jupyter notebook:
```
jupyter notebook Captcha_model.ipynb
```
2. Follow the steps in the notebook to load data, preprocess it, build the model, and train it.

## Model Training
The notebook covers:
* Data loading and preprocessing: Steps to load and preprocess the CAPTCHA images.
* Model architecture: Detailed explanation of the CNN architecture used.
* Training: Process to train the model on the CAPTCHA dataset.
* Evaluation: Methods to evaluate the model's performance on unseen data.

## Results
The model achieves [mention accuracy/other metrics] on the test dataset. Detailed results and performance metrics are provided in the notebook.
